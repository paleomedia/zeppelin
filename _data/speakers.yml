  surname: "Shtereva"

  title: “Abstract Expressionist Painter"
  bio: "Lilian is a Brooklyn-based painter who got her start in the arts growing up in Haskovo, Bulgaria. She studied at The Faculty of Fine Arts in Veliko Tarnovo, Bulgaria. She employs oil paint as a medium, gravitating towards colors and textures inspired by nature. The variations of texture and density within her practice, from heavy impasto to thin washes and drips, emphasize the tactile nature of the medium. In her work there is a great sensitivity to the imaginal realms that allows fantastical visions to unfold and find form. Lilian is a proud recipient of the Define American Artist Fellowship 2019. Most of her work can be seen in local Brooklyn group shows."

  title: “Artist”
  bio: "There is a Wild-ness in every step we take, if Wild, we wish to be. Dan Trabue wishes to be wild. His artwork (mostly watercolor and pen and ink) tends to focus on natural themes, the sky, the land, the trees, the wildlife in the area. Infused into these natural themes, Dan works in people playing music, dancing, poetry, and working for a more just, welcoming and green world. His art tends to be whimsical and fun, bright and cheery, but there are heavy matters at play in his art, as well. Dan is a relatively new artist, but he has shown up at local festivals and his art has been at the Wayside Expressions Gallery. Dan loves collaborating with other artists across media and embracing the Community of the Wild wherever it may be found."
