  name: "Lilian"
  surname: "Shtereva"
  company: "Define American Artist Fellow"
  title: “Abstract Expressionist Painter"
  bio: "Lilian is a Brooklyn-based painter who got her start in the arts growing up in Haskovo, Bulgaria. She studied at The Faculty of Fine Arts in Veliko Tarnovo, Bulgaria. She employs oil paint as a medium, gravitating towards colors and textures inspired by nature. The variations of texture and density within her practice, from heavy impasto to thin washes and drips, emphasize the tactile nature of the medium. In her work there is a great sensitivity to the imaginal realms that allows fantastical visions to unfold and find form. Lilian is a proud recipient of the Define American Artist Fellowship 2019. Most of her work can be seen in local Brooklyn group shows."
