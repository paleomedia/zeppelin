She employs oil paint as a medium, gravitating towards colors and textures inspired by nature. The variations of texture and density within her practice, from heavy impasto to thin washes and drips, emphasize the tactile nature of the medium. In her work there is a great sensitivity to the imaginal realms that allows fantastical visions to unfold and find form. Lilian is a proud recipient of the Define American Artist Fellowship 2019. Most of her work can be seen in local Brooklyn group shows."

His clients' stories have been told to  legislators, governors, and policy makers. His ability to advocate in this way is why he was appointed by Gov. Terry McAuliffe to serve on the Virginia Asian Advisory Board, helping advise the Governor on issues facing the AAPI community. and beyond, as well as the Commonwealth Commission on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. It is why he also serves on the board of the Dulles Justice Coalition, the group of airport lawyers who represented clients in the wake of President Trump's travel ban.
