  title: "Our priority: examining the state of our mental health and how we move forward."
  description: "What does it mean to prioritize our mental health? As community members, we often set aside caring for our mental health as the lowest “to do” on our checklists. On the other hand, we also are bombarded with romanticized versions of “self-care” in the pursuit of mental wellness. In this session, we will have the opportunity to dig deeper into what is impacting our mental health and the importance of integrating intention and action for the sake of our well-being."

But ultimately, both are propelled by an undergirding of white supremacy and a successful effort to create narratives that show people of color as criminals. Through this panel, we explore the intersection of two powerful movements for liberation and justice."

  description: "In 2012, Jose Antonio Vargas and 34 brave Undocumented Americans came out publicly on the cover of TIME Magazine. Their stories were instrumental in the Obama administration’s creation of DACA… but we are in a new era and a new administration. Define American, National Geographic, and the University of Massachusetts–Amherst followed up with the original 35 to find out how these courageous folks found resilience in their resistance and how we can learn from their insights how to build truly empowering and enduring Coming Out movements. In this session, you will get a first look at findings from this groundbreaking new study, slated for publication in national outlets in March 2020."
