The inaugural Define American Summit invites media makers, new Americans, activists, students, religious leaders, and creative influencers from across the political spectrum to fight for more accurate media narratives in their local communities.

Together, we will reimagine American identity in the 21st century.

Join us in Louisville, Kentucky from October 10-13, 2019 and keep an eye on this page for announcements about programming. Letâ€™s keep changing culture for the better!

## Explore, Learn, and Create
We will explore American identity through music, dance, comedy, spoken word, drama, and art; and share ideas about mental health and self-care, forming healthy habits resulting in less burnout and more culture change.

Attendees will participate in innovative workshops and opportunities to hear from movement leaders in the media, entertainment, faith, and grassroots organizing realms. They will have critical conversations across ideological perspectives with conservative, libertarian, and religious leaders in the immigrant freedom movement. And they will learn new storytelling techniques and record their own stories, stories of migration, race, identity, and citizenship in an ever-evolving nation.
